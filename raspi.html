    Raspberry Pi is a family of single board computers.  They come in a variety of shapes, sizes
    and specifications.  Ranging from They can be flashed with virtually any firmware and can be used for
    a variety of applications.  They are especially popular for use as retro gaming consoles, smart
    home integration, and IoT connectivity.  Below are a few of the projects that I have built using the
    Raspberry Pi platform.

    This my first attempt at a practical Raspberry Pi project.  My girlfriend was always having trouble
    connecting her phone to the Android Auto interface in her car, and it was somewhat inconvenient to
    plug the phone into the car's USB port every time she wanted to connect the phone to the car.  There
    are a few companies that sell dongles that plug into the car and connect to the phone wirelessly, but
    they cost nearly $100.  I was able to buy the Raspberry Pi for about $25, 3d print the case for a few
    cents, and download a custom firmware for free.  The result was a fully functional wireless Android Auto
    wireless adapter for a fraction of the cost of a commercially available one. Materials used:

    There are numerous uses for Raspberry Pi computers, but one of the most popular is for using them to emulate
    retro video games.  There are several options for software, but I opted for Batocera, which is a gaming-specific
    Linux distribution.  I simply downloaded the .ios file, flashed it onto a microSD card, and was able to boot up
    my new game emulator within a few minutes.  I spent a few hours hunting the internet for game ROMS to play, and
    now I have a credit-card sized gaming system that plays the entire library NES, SNES, and N64 games.  It's a 90's
    video game nerd's dream.  The materials used were as follows:</p>
