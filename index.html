    Hello and welcome to my personal page.  This page started as a project
    for a Web Development class but hopefully will     evolve into a fully functional,
    professional portfolio page bu the time I'm     done with it. I'm currently attending
    classes for my last semester Cal State East Bay University pursuing a B.S. in
    Computer Science.  I am set to graduate in December 2025.  For the last 10
    years I have worked as Stagehand and Stage Rigger for IATSE Local 16
    in San Francisco. During my career I have had the opportunity to work with
    Broadway theatrical productions, countless live concert events and music
    festivals, the SF Symphony, and several films and television shows.  I have
    enjoyed my time as a stagehand and will forever look back at it fondly as some
    of the best years of my adult life.  That being said, I made a decision earlier this
    year to exit the entertainment industry to pursue a career in the technology
    sector.  I have have always been passionate about computers and technology
    and I am looking forward to transitioning from a hobbyist to a technology professional.</p>
