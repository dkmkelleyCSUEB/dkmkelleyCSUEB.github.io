    Hello and welcome to my personal page.  This page started as a project
    for a Web Development class but hopefully will evolve into a fully functional,
    professional portfolio page by the time I'm done with it. I'm currently finishing
    my last semester at Cal State East Bay University pursuing a B.S. in
    Computer Science.  I am set to graduate in December 2025.  For the last 10
    years I have worked as a Stagehand and Stage Rigger for IATSE Local 16
    in San Francisco. During my career I have had the opportunity to work with touring
    Broadway theatrical productions, countless live concert events and music
    festivals, the SF Symphony, trade shows, product launches, conferences and
    several films and television shows.  I have enjoyed my time as a stagehand and
    will forever look back at it fondly as some of the best years of my working
    adult life.  That being said, I made a decision earlier this year to exit the
    entertainment industry to pursue a career in the technology sector.  I have
    have always been passionate about computers and technology and I am looking
    forward to transitioning from a hobbyist to a technology professional.I am
    currently seeking positions in the following fields: software development, software QA,
    systems administration, AI/ML, and information security. </p>

    I have a wide range of interests, especially those having to do with computers and/or
    electronics.  Even though work and school keep me fairly busy,
    I still find time to enjoy a number of hobbies including:</p>
    <ul style="text-align: start">
    <li>Amateur radio, Meshtastic radios, and software-defined radio
    <li>3D modeling using SolidWorks and 3D printing
    <li>Various raspberry pi projects
    <li>Python, Java, Javascript, and Android projects
  </ul>
    <p class = container style="text-indent: 40px">
      This section will be used to document those hobbies with pictures, and descriptions,
      as well as links to 3D model files, PCB designs, schematics, and links to additional
      online resources. Soon I hope to have completed a few simple JavaScript applications,
      as well some Android apps that I have been working on in my Mobile Development class.</p>
