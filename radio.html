  <p class = "container">
    Meshtastic provides secure, two-way text communication via an ad-hoc mesh network of LoRa
  radio device.  When paired with a phone or tablet, these devices allow users to communicate
  without the use of internet or mobile phone service.  Below are some of the devices that I have
  built for secure communication in the event of a natural disaster, when traditional communications
  like cell phones and the internet may become unreliable due to a surge in use. For more
  information about Meshtastic please visit: https://www.meshtastic.org

  This is a device I put together from various parts I found on and off the internet. For this
    build I used: </p>
  <ul style="text-align: start">
    <li>RAK Wisblock 4631 radio kit
    <li>up-cycled 3.7v battery pack from an old router
    <li><a href ="https://bayme.sh" target="_blank">Baymesh</a> 2 cavity filter
    <li>Alfa 915MHz LoRa antenna
    <li>8"x 8" waterproof outdoor electrical enclosure with a door for easy access
  </ul>

      The RAK Wisblock 4631 is a fine device, but it is somewhat underpowered at a mere 250mW.
    For this build I opted for a device with a more powerful transmitter, in a durable and
    waterproof enclosure. The materials used were as follows:</p>
    <ul style="text-align: start">
      <li>Station G2 1W meshtastic node
      <li>10,000mAh battery bank
      <li>standard right angle 915MHz LoRa antenna
      <li>Apache 1800 waterproof carrying case
    </ul>

    <p class = "container" style="text-indent: 40px">
      This was the first device I made using the Station G2 as a starting point.  It is
      permanently mounted on a pole on the roof of my house and serves as my base station node
      I learned quite a bit from this build, albeit mostly "what NOT to do" for a Meshtastic build.</p>
    <ul style="text-align: start">
      <li>Station G2 1W meshtastic node
      <li>20' PD-capable USB-C cable for power
      <li>Alfa 915MHz LoRa antenna
      <li><a href ="https://bayme.sh" target="_blank">Baymesh</a> 1 cavity filter (not pictured)
      <li>Cantex 8" x 8" waterproof electrical enclosure
    </ul>
